    let items = [1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 8, 5, 4, 9, 0, 1, 3, 2, 6, 7, 5,

    Please write down a function to console log unique value from this array.
    **/

    A:
    function getUniqueNumber(items) {
    return Array.from(new Set(items));
    }

4.  /** What is different between <section> and <article>, can you make an example how you
    will be using it? **/

    A: I would use <article> for individual content, say blog posts, videos, or images etc.
    <section> would be used to form groups according to functionality or theme (from content).
    So normaly, <ariticle>s would be grouped in <section>, I would avoid further grouping <section> in
    <article> for cleaner structer, though it depends.

5.  /** Please explain about what is CSS boxing model and the layout components that it
    consists of.
    **/

    A: Every visual element presented on the dom comes in the unit of a 'box'.
    This box consists of 'content', 'padding', 'border' and 'margin'.
    All layout and spacing are calculated according to these box units.

6.  /** Can you explain CSS priority, and what principle are your used to writing CSS
    stylesheet. **/

    A: !important > inline styles > id > classes > elements > \*
    I've used BEM, atomic (or component), or a simple distinction between typography and layout.
    Have also used more utility classes from tailwindCss which often follows a mobile-first philosophy.

7.  /** Can you introducing some of Semantic HTML elements that you already know and how you
    used it ever, please make some example. **/

    A: For general layout, i always use <header>, <section>, <article>, <nav>, <figure>/<figcaption> whenever i can.
    For tabular data, i would always construct the table including <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, and a clear use of <th> and <td>.

    Other's I might be aware of but seldom used include <aside>, <dt>, <dd>, <pre>, etc as i find them not that descriptive.
    I also avoid using <b>, <i> (unless suggested from UI framework) and almost always use <span>.
